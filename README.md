# California Housing Price Prediction

# Overview

#### This project predicts house prices using the California Housing dataset with an XGBoost Regressor. The dataset includes features like median income, house age, population, and more.

# Steps

#### Load Dataset: Fetch California housing data from Scikit-learn.

####  Preprocess Data: Handle missing values and explore correlations.

#### Split Data: Train-test split (80-20%).

#### Train Model: Use XGBoost Regressor for prediction.

#### Evaluate: Measure RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

#### Visualize: Plot actual vs. predicted prices.

# Results

#### High RÂ² Score, indicating strong model performance.

#### Low MAE, ensuring accurate price predictions.

# Future Improvements

#### Feature engineering & hyperparameter tuning.

#### Comparison with other regression models.

# Conclusion

#### This project demonstrates XGBoost's effectiveness in predicting house prices with high accuracy. ðŸš€
